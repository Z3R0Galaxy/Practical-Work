## Lab 120.3B - Flowcharts to Python
### Overview
This lab asks you to write Python code based on a provided flowchart that calculates and displays the average of a set of positive numbers entered by the user. The number of inputs is not fixed in advance. Youâ€™ll also implement error checking and use modular functions.

### Learning objectives
- Interpret branching and looping logic in flowcharts
- Use condition-controlled loops (WHILE) and exception handling
- Encapsulate logic into reusable functions
### Instructions
1. Analyse the file `binary_search_flowchart.png` and 
2. Do a dry run of the algorithm and create trace tables for the following test cases:
- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
- [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
- [G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P]
- [blue, brown, green, orange, pink, purple, red, white, yellow]

3. Write a Python program that implements the logic described in the flowchart.
4. Test your program with the test cases provided above.
